      <p className='about'>Slaughter of the Slice is a one of a kind, metal inspired pizza purgatory!  We use only the hottest burning Hell Fire in our stone oven to cook each pizza to perferction.  With spiked guantlets, horned helments and corpse paint, all of our employees are dressed to kill!  We use swords to slice all our pizzas and each order is served on a traditional viking war shield. </p>
